**Executive Summary:**
This report looks at how hospitals in the United States handled COVID-19 hospitalizations. We reviewed data with respect to hospital ownership, bed capacity, and confirmed COVID-19 cases to learn how well hospitals managed the incremental surge in patients during the pandemic.

****Main objectives****

Hospital Capacity and Occupancy: To see how hospitals managed bed availability and occupancy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ownership and Bed Utilization: To understand how different types of hospital ownership (like private, government, or non-profit) impacted the use of beds as well as the effect of staffed ICU beds and availability of Emergency Services.
Trends in Hospital Efficiency: To find out how hospital ratings and their locations affected how well they handled COVID-19 cases.
To analyze vaccination trends and formulate a plan for managing future vaccination uptake.

****Key Findings****

Non-profit private hospitals, providing over 55% of bed capacity, were crucial in handling the pandemic.
States that handled COVID situation better had higher staffed ICU beds for COVID patients and emergency services were available for majority of the hospitals.
Massachusetts had high non-ICU bed usage due to the prevalence of short-term hospitals managing most non-critical COVID-19 cases.
California, Texas, and Florida saw the most hospitalizations, but ICU usage declined over time as vaccines and treatments improved.
States with more emergency service-equipped hospitals, like Texas and California, were better at managing patient surges, while states like Missouri showed a need for stronger emergency infrastructure.
COVID-19 hospitalizations followed a seasonal pattern, peaking in winter and dropping in summer across multiple years.
Higher-rated hospitals managed bed occupancy more efficiently, with fewer fluctuations compared to lower-rated hospitals.
Influenza and COVID-19 exhibit similar symptoms and are particularly prevalent during peak seasons, which can pose challenges for diagnosis but also provide valuable insights for understanding future spreading diseases.
Vaccination peak trends varied in micropolitan and metropolitan regions of states. In micropolitan states, Wisconsin had high vaccination rates in 2021, and Washington increased its vaccination efforts by 2023. This displayed a difference in acceptance of vaccines in different states.
